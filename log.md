# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## DAY 1 - 26/02/2023

**Today's Progress**: (1) Solved Day 1's 3 coding exercises from darkprinx's 'Break the Ice With Python', (2) helped a beginner user learn to use CodeWars and explained an improved solution to their problem, (3) created logistic regression models for university admission and a bank's telemarketing campaign, assessed their accuracy. The university admissions model was the tutorial, the bank model was indepdent practice.

**Thoughts** (1) The coding exercises were fairly easy, solving them helped me (re)learn about generators and dictionary comprehension, (2) the logistic regression models were tiring but fun. While the methods appplied were intuitive once I came to understand the maths the code in the tutorials was dense. Reading around the libraries to cement my understanding helped, as did working through the code the code step by step. Coming to this understanding made the independent exercises easier, though revieiwng the solutions to the exercises revealed where I could have been more efficient. For example, binding the independent features to a variable name 'estimators' instead of typing them in for x1 every time.

## DAY 2 - 27/02/2023

**Today's Progress**: (1) Solved Day 2's Questions 4 through 6 coding exercises from darkprinx's 'Break the Ice With Python', (2) researched how to plan some small Python projects e.g. expenses tracker, (3) was introduced to cluster analysis, and the differences between clustering and classification 

**Thoughts** (1) The coding exercises were good practice, I was able to use the class object constructor and was pleased that my solution to Question 6 came out so well compared to other solutions as I had properly applied functional programming, (2) listening ForestKnight's and Sterkowitz's YT videos gave me the understanding and confidence to proceede with my own Python projects, so I will begin on a simple expenses tracker tomorrow ... thinking about how it could be developed, use of SQL and measure behavouiral factors like adverts seen that day (3) cluster analysis was fairly intuitive, as was the maths behind, looking forward to K-means clustering tomorrow

## DAY 3 - 28/02/2023

**Today's Progress**: (1) Solved Day 2's Questions 7 through 9 coding exercises from darkprinx's 'Break the Ice With Python', (2) introduction to and some exercises for k-means clustering, (3) pseudo-code for expenses tracker

**Thoughts** (1) developed some research skills here, discovered how to input multiple lines including inputting empty lines which I actually solved as asked unlike the provided solutions -- raised issue on repository, (2) k-means fairly intuitive so far, looking forward to practical application in market segmentation, (3) excited to write my first real project, start small and develop it from there to have a nice simple project for my portfolio

## DAY 4- 01/03/2023

**Today's Progress**: (1) Solved Day 3's Questions 10 through 12 coding exercises from darkprinx's 'Break the Ice With Python', (2) some more clustering theory, too fatigued to get serious work done in Jupyter Notebooks(3) first commit to expenses tracker

**Thoughts** (1) fairly easy, dealing with strings and comprehensions, (2) will move this forward as first item of the day for 02/03 as it's going too slow for my liking, (3) very happy with the tracker so far, great confidence boost to see it all working in it's most basic form

## DAY 5- 02/03/2023

**Today's Progress**: (1) Solved Day 3's Questions 13 coding exercise from darkprinx's 'Break the Ice With Python', (2) K-Means market segmentation (3) updated expense tracker methods and some conditional arguments

**Thoughts** I'm unhappy with lack of progress today, I would have like to solve 3 problems and made good progress on both data science/ml and my expenses tracker

## DAY 6- 03/03/2023

**Today's Progress**: (1) Solved Day 3's Questions 14 and 15 coding exercise from darkprinx's 'Break the Ice With Python', (2) first part of species segmentation (3) updated expense tracker to print easily understandable table updated relationships between arrays

**Thoughts** I feel I could have done better, but made good use of the time that was given to me, I should have completed that expenses tracker project by tomorrow and cleared the ground for the Deep Learning sections of the DS course

## DAY 7- 04/03/2023

**Today's Progress**: (1) Solved Day 4's Questions 15 and 16 coding exercise from darkprinx's 'Break the Ice With Python', (2) linear algebra for machine learning (scalars, vectors, matrices, tensors and operations for them), it's implementation in programming (3) expense tracker fully interactive, tomorrow need to enable reading of array from txt file and unique ID checker, also all round values with two digits except where not printed but used for operations

**Thoughts**: Okay, expenses tracker certainly done by tomorrow. Any further additions beyond what is proposed above would be superfluous for a simple project. The exercises were easy today. Linear algebra was good, not entirely intuitive at first but I read around the subject and came to understand it. Looking forward to neural nets tomorrow.

## DAY 8- 05/03/2023

**Today's Progress**: (1) Solved Day 5's Questions 17 and 18 coding exercise from darkprinx's 'Break the Ice With Python', (2) introduction to neural networks (3) expense tracker fully interactive, only addition was allowing for rounded float values

**Thoughts**: Fatigued (?) today ... the challenges were frustrating as use of RegEx, introduction to neural networks clarified the foundations fo machine learning and its aims. Did not make as much progress as I had hoped for with the Expenses Tracker, discovered would need RegEx to read array from saved files which violated the rules of the project (no imported modules). I'm going to disregard this for the next project as I feel I could demonstrate my basic competency with Python AS WELL AS deploying it for real practical use.

## DAY 8- 06/03/2023

**Today's Progress**: (1) Solved Day 6's Questions 19 and 20 coding exercise from darkprinx's 'Break the Ice With Python', (2) introduction to neural networks finished (3) pseudo-code and inputs for calculator project

**Thoughts**: Challenges were p easy, I don't recall much of their content ... finished introduction to neural networks, the gradient descent (optimization algorithm) was challenging as lots of maths but once I understood derivatives through Khan Academy they became understandable, I will have to re-read and condense my notes + practice for a proper understanding . . . calculator project should be quite challenging, I foresee order of operations being an issue .... perhaps enter all at once, then ask user to check input and edit from their as opposed to CE ... does python automatically account for order of operations? Regarding modules, I have decided to hold off as calculator project shouldn't require any imported modules

## DAY 10 - 08/03/2023

**Today's Progress**: (1) Focused on my calculator project today, made classful and solved some problems related to tail recursion, pruning classes of excess information, classes calling on each other etc.

**Thoughts**: I'm quite happy with my progress today, once I focused to apply logic and sound reasoning to the problems at hand (coupled with some search skills) I achieved the outputs I desired ... I also learnt of Observer pattern https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern design which I may implement for this project or in a duplicate of this project
