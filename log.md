# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## DAY 1 - 26/02/2023

**Today's Progress**: (1) Solved Day 1's 3 coding exercises from darkprinx's 'Break the Ice With Python', (2) helped a beginner user learn to use CodeWars and explained an improved solution to their problem, (3) created logistic regression models for university admission and a bank's telemarketing campaign, assessed their accuracy. The university admissions model was the tutorial, the bank model was indepdent practice.

**Thoughts** (1) The coding exercises were fairly easy, solving them helped me (re)learn about generators and dictionary comprehension, (2) the logistic regression models were tiring but fun. While the methods appplied were intuitive once I came to understand the maths the code in the tutorials was dense. Reading around the libraries to cement my understanding helped, as did working through the code the code step by step. Coming to this understanding made the independent exercises easier, though revieiwng the solutions to the exercises revealed where I could have been more efficient. For example, binding the independent features to a variable name 'estimators' instead of typing them in for x1 every time.

## DAY 2 - 27/02/2023

**Today's Progress**: (1) Solved Day 2's Questions 4 through 6 coding exercises from darkprinx's 'Break the Ice With Python', (2) researched how to plan some small Python projects e.g. expenses tracker, (3) was introduced to cluster analysis, and the differences between clustering and classification 

**Thoughts** (1) The coding exercises were good practice, I was able to use the class object constructor and was pleased that my solution to Question 6 came out so well compared to other solutions as I had properly applied functional programming, (2) listening ForestKnight's and Sterkowitz's YT videos gave me the understanding and confidence to proceede with my own Python projects, so I will begin on a simple expenses tracker tomorrow ... thinking about how it could be developed, use of SQL and measure behavouiral factors like adverts seen that day (3) cluster analysis was fairly intuitive, as was the maths behind, looking forward to K-means clustering tomorrow
